# üçï Faasos Delivery Project Analysis (SQL) - Day 7

<img src = 'image.jpeg' />

This project is part of my **"7 Days, 7 SQL Projects"** challenge, where I built one SQL-based data analysis project every day for a week.  
On **Day 7**, I performed in-depth analysis of Faasos delivery orders dataset using SQL.

---

## üìå Project Overview
The project simulates real-world food delivery data and answers important questions such as:
- Total rolls ordered and unique customers
- Roll type distribution (Veg/Non-Veg)
- Successful delivery rates per driver
- Peak ordering times and weekdays
- Average delivery times, speeds, and distances
- Customer order customization patterns

---

## üìÇ Dataset Description

**Tables Created**
1. **driver** ‚Äì Driver ID and registration date  
2. **ingredients** ‚Äì Ingredient details  
3. **rolls** ‚Äì Veg and Non-Veg roll types  
4. **rolls_recipes** ‚Äì Roll-to-ingredients mapping  
5. **driver_order** ‚Äì Delivery details, distance, duration, cancellation status  
6. **customer_orders** ‚Äì Order details, customization, and timestamps  

---

## üõ† SQL Concepts Used
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- Conditional logic: `CASE WHEN`
- Joins: `INNER JOIN`
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Date and time functions: `EXTRACT`, `TO_CHAR`
- Window functions: `RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`
- String operations: `REPLACE`, `TRIM`, `POSITION`, `LEFT`

8. Orders with both exclusions and extras  
9. Orders by hour of day  
10. Orders by weekday  
11. Average pickup time per driver  
12. Relationship between rolls count & preparation time  
13. Average distance per customer  
14. Difference between longest & shortest delivery times  
15. Average speed per driver  
16. Successful delivery percentage per driver

	COUNT(driver_id) as b
FROM
(select 
	*,
	CASE WHEN cancellation ILIKE '%cancellation%' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS cancellation_new

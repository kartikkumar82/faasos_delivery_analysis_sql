# üçï Faasos Delivery Project Analysis (SQL) - Day 7

<img src = 'image.jpeg' />

This project is part of my **"7 Days, 7 SQL Projects"** challenge, where I built one SQL-based data analysis project every day for a week.  
On **Day 7**, I performed in-depth analysis of Faasos delivery orders dataset using SQL.

---

## üìå Project Overview
The project simulates real-world food delivery data and answers important questions such as:
- Total rolls ordered and unique customers
- Roll type distribution (Veg/Non-Veg)
- Successful delivery rates per driver
- Peak ordering times and weekdays
- Average delivery times, speeds, and distances
- Customer order customization patterns

---

## üìÇ Dataset Description

**Tables Created**
1. **driver** ‚Äì Driver ID and registration date  
2. **ingredients** ‚Äì Ingredient details  
3. **rolls** ‚Äì Veg and Non-Veg roll types  
4. **rolls_recipes** ‚Äì Roll-to-ingredients mapping  
5. **driver_order** ‚Äì Delivery details, distance, duration, cancellation status  
6. **customer_orders** ‚Äì Order details, customization, and timestamps

## üõ† SQL Concepts Used
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`
- Conditional logic: `CASE WHEN`
- Joins: `INNER JOIN`
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Date and time functions: `EXTRACT`, `TO_CHAR`
- Window functions: `RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`
- String operations: `REPLACE`, `TRIM`, `POSITION`, `LEFT`

## üìú Key Questions Answered

### Basic Analysis
1. Total rolls ordered

## üìä Sample Query

### 1Ô∏è Successful Orders by Driver
```sql
SELECT
    driver_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS successful_orders
FROM driver_order
WHERE cancellation NOT IN ('Cancellation', 'Customer Cancellation')
GROUP BY driver_id;

```

### 1. how many rolls where ordered?
```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(roll_id)
FROM customer_orders


```

### 2. how many unique customer orders were made ?
```sql
SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM customer_orders

```


###  3. how many sucessful orders were delivered by each driver?
```sql
SELECT
	driver_id,
	COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)
FROM driver_order
WHERE cancellation NOT IN ('Cancellation' , 'Customer Cancellation')
GROUP BY 1;

```

###  4. how many of each type of roll was delivered ?
```sql

                ELSE duration

```sql
SELECT
	*
FROM
(SELECT
	driver_id,
	distance,
	duration,
	AVG(distance/duration)  as avg_speed
FROM
	(SELECT

		REPLACE
			(distance, 'km' , ' ')::float AS distance,
		CAST(
	            CASE 
	                WHEN duration LIKE '%min%' 
	                THEN LEFT(duration, POSITION('m' IN duration) - 1) 
	                ELSE duration 
	            END AS INTEGER
	        ) AS duration
FROM driver_order) AS a
GROUP BY 1,2,3) AS b
WHERE avg_speed IS NOT NULL;
```

###  16. what is the sucessfull delivery time for each driver?
```sql
SELECT
	driver_id,
	c*1.0/b AS sucessfull_percentage
FROM
(SELECT 
	driver_id,
	sum(cancellation_new) AS c,
	COUNT(driver_id) as b
FROM
(select 
	*,
	CASE WHEN cancellation ILIKE '%cancellation%' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS cancellation_new 
from driver_order) AS a 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
